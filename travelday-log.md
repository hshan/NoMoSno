Ashland RV Campground

Very new well maintained park with level concrete pad sites, very spacious. So new it didn't show up on Google maps satellite view yet. Very easy online check in at the park. Lots of open sites when we arrived on a Thursday evening. Quiet, in town but at the edge. We camped at Ashland RV Campground in a Fifth Wheel.

North Sterling State Park

Very rustic gravel sites that were basically just a turnout of the campground loop. They had nice wind protection shells over the picnic tables. Wide open, scenic views of the reservoir, but the water was really low this time of year. Saw pelicans, deer, and heard coyotes howling at night. Quiet friendly neighbors, many come up from the nearby town of Sterling. The dump station was great, large, easy to access, clean and uncrowded. We camped at North Sterling State Park in a Fifth Wheel

Saddleback RV Park at Battlement Mesa

This is a large RV park with many long term sites as well as mobile homes. We arrived early evening after being unable to find a site anywhere along our route in Colorado. The office was closed but we talked to a couple that told us to find an open site and then pay by check at the office drop box. The sites were a little hard to figure out, each site was Y shaped with A and B designations. Some of the campers there were clearly taking up both sites. We found a paved site with 50 amp power at the edge of the park that seemed to be in the long term rental section but had absolutely gorgeous vistas of the mountains and Colorado River which was great. Very quiet, nice neighbors. Woke to elk bugles in the river valley below-breathtaking. The park is not well maintained but for the price it was worth it and we were very happy with our stay.
Arrive before 6 PM if you want to check in at the office or need to use laundry facilities. They offer 10% discount for Good Sam and 50% for Passport America. We camped at Saddleback RV Park at Battlement Mesa in a Fifth Wheel.

Green River KOA

Stayed here to access Moab, good location at the edge of town. They were booked up for 3 weeks but we were lucky to reserve a site due to a last minute cancellation. All the amenities of a KOA, sites were spacious and level. They had a shared patio area between sites that would be great if you were camping with famiy/friends but was a little awkward if no desire to share your patio with your neighbor. We were there on a Sunday evening and there was very loud grinding/sawing metal building construction activity all afternoon into the evening. Finally at 7:30 PM after dusk, some of the campers went over to ask them to stop and they did (though came back at 7 AM the next morning for an hour to finish). We camped at Green River KOA in a Fifth Wheel.

Cave Lake State Park (Elk Flat Campground)

Arrive early, first come first serve. We arrived around 5 PM and were able to get into the last site in Elk Flats which is the first campground in the park. The road off of hwy 50 is paved except for maybe a half mile of gravel into the park which wasn't too bad. Well maintained gravel, not too rutted. The campground was gorgeous, wooded with beautiful vistas of the mountains, exceptionally clean sites. Very quiet. No electric, water spigots available at various locations. There is a group site available by reservation, and an ADA site that is paved. Each site had a nice cast iron covered fire grill and pit. Our site was pretty tight for a 36 ft fifth wheel but we made it work. We camped at Cave Lake State Park (Elk Flat Campground) in a Fifth Wheel.

 Harvest Hosts .. Lattin Farms Fallon, NV.

 Got our pic of site being first there.. Large dirt parking lot. Really dry and dusty. Karen bought some produce from the store. Steve talked with Farm manager next morning for about an hour. Nice people. Quiet place. Good experience. The town is an oasis in the middle of desert. Topgun movie shot there. Big airforce presence in area though, we weren't bothered ..not much flying when we were visiting.

### 2020-09-23 Wed  5:55 PM

Arrived at Sir and Ryan's house around 5:30.. just in time for people heading home. Siri directed traffic and after a dozen false starts (due to traffic), finally committed and got the rig in. Ryan held the wires up to clear top of rig. Siri and Ryan had spent some time trying to clear branches and limbs that might rip roof. Took it slow and made it in with no permanent damage. Some awning covers were jerked off.

Day two here. Spent most of day with Wilder and Bergen, playing with them and getting to know them again. Interspersed with trying to get rig into shape for the stay!

We cooked chile and Ryan did biscuits for the chile

We are here at Petaluma, already going on the third day! Today Siri went into her shop to work after noon. Wilder and Bergen went to their community family's home until 5:00pm. Karen and Siri went for a run. I cleared out the garage and rode bike on cyclops for first time. Ryan is cooking dinner tonight. Pad thai I think. Karen just left to pick up Siri and the kids. Ryan and Siri bought a play castle, used for $400.00 that we have to try and pick up sometime and assemble.

Day four in Petaluma. Hot and sunny. Siri went to work at noon. Ry,Kar,Wild,Berg,Taz,Verd, and I went for shorty walk at flood area park a couple miles away. Worked up a sweat just casually walking. Second time lifting weights in the garage. Getting it down. Between biking and weights, should have some assemblance of good workout options.. at the very leasg.

### 2020-09-28 Mon  1:43 PM


Day five with the Fritches. This was yesterday (forgot to write). Slowly getting rig things in order. Bought new 120v --> 30amp connector after one yesterday nearly melted?! Able to drain gray water through hose now that amazon delivered hose connection yesterday.

Siri said she is feeling very strange today.. not as much sickness but more beside herself, maybe depleted. She went to work today @ 10:00 . Sale going on. Meeting individuals on a schedule.. one to one.

No daycare tomorrow or the rest of the week Siri told me on phone.

Ryan baked awesome pizza on his pizza oven last night! So good!

Karen ran on roads today with Taz. I lifted weights. Ryan watered plants and out in studio mostly. His "Hackintosh"'s bluetooth doesn't work.

We tried to go to Dillon Beach yesterday, but it was full. So, we went bach through Tomale and down to Key Creek Fishing Accesss. Crossed the river and the kids swam and played for hours. All of them.

Day six. Much better air today. Temps cool. Siri home today. Karen and I went to Costco for first time since getting here. James and Ryan picked up the swingset/playhouse. Much smaller then I thought. Will probably be a project next day or two. Wilder watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Very shaky internet connections here. So frustrating. Had fun night with kids. Wilder cuddling, Bergen and Wilder teasing me .. taking away my hat. First Presidential debate was tonight. Not presidential.

I missed a few days. Three days ago Ry cooked Thai with nan. Two days ago was our day, but Ry couldn't resist :-)  .. "helped with" Huevos, I did the turkey "sausage" and tortillas. 

Yesterday, Aaron, Taylor, and Runa made it here around 5:00pm! Parked and situated right next to each other.

Wonderful meal Ryan cooked mostly. Steak and cod burritos. I did the tortillas and Mahi Mahi.

Yesterday Ryan and I got the swingset all put together after a few trips to landscpaper for ground prep. Kids loved it!

Smoke was good yesterday! This am woke to fog and little smoke! Looking to be wonderful day! 

Siri and Ryan's 6th wedding anniversary today. They plan to go out alone for an evening meal!

We stayed in Schuyler (skyler) Nebraska , at a cute little campground that was supposed to be closed Nov 1. North lake county park near Columbus Nebraska closed Nov 1st. Luckily Karen called while on the road and we were able to find this place.

Karen ran last night on the paved path around the little pond. I dumped water again and re-filled to rid of chlorine hopefully. Full 50A hookup which we didn't need (sewer) for $15. Only one other 5th wheel here. Quite a bit of local dog walkers use the trail.

Met a local named Gene, an older gentleman that stopped to offer advise when we were backing in. Good natured truck driver with endless stories which were enjoyable. He wouild even listen to a couple of mine. :)

 Taz is frustrated. He didn't take over two steps out of the truck to realize we were in goathead territory. Poor guy. Lots of limping and help removing them from his feet.

Pulled in here yesterday afternoon after missing snow the day before. Snow on the ground. Temp in the 30's. Low last night was 24. 8300' elevation. No verizon service. Setup Starlink for first time outside rig. Found a way to route cable through back ramp. Had turned on "roam" on my residential account. Dishy came out of "stow" mode and located satellites. Worked perfectly. Throttled because on roam. 23 down 6 up. Workable.

After setup, hiked 3 mile loop through beautiful rock formations, aspens, and conifers. Probably walked more than 3 because we turned back not knowing what was in front of us, with limited daylight.

Turkey goulash in instant pot for dinner, watched some tv.

Trying to run genny to charge batteries after 2 days of no sun. Genny quit. Couldn't manually start. Furnace and fridge running on propane. Fridge died at night "NO FL" (no flame) error. Batteries dropped to 34% over night.

Learned that there is a high altitude adjustment on the Onana 5500. Got up this am and made adjustment and she fired right up. Remembered a "magnet" reset on the Norcold refrig that I had found on internet one other time we had that trouble at hight altitude. Not sure about the "fix". But working now.

One more walk before we head to Sweetwater :-)

Rock Spring, Wyoming, got in to Sweetwater Event Center late afternoon.  Expansive fairgrounds with over 1200 RV sites with FHUs @ $30/night, can boondock for $10/night.  Easy access from I-80, entered through the "lifestock" entrance and checked in with Kay, one of the caretakers that live on the property.  She charged us $20 for electric hook up only per our request.  Only about 100 sites to choose from that were winterized.  Sites were basically a U-shaped fence on gravel, no rules for how we parked. Free restroom/showers-bldg with individual units consisting of sink, toilet and shower.  Heated and clean. Nice fenced in dog park.  We made broccoli cheese soup in the instapot and Steve grilled deli turkey sandwiches on Gary.  High winds (altitude 6300).

Salt Lake City, Utah:  KOA campground on North Temple right in near downtown (1.3 miles).  No issues traveling here except for intermittent light rains, though there were winter storm warnings in mountainous areas west of SLC.  The KOA campground is massive, with many permanent sites.  Well laid out and nice paved sites although ours was a little uneven. Pool closed but outdoor hot tub open year round (I quickly lost interest due to the pelting rain).  KOA is adjacent to the Jordan River that runs through SLC with a 50 mile long paved trail in the riverside green space, so took Taz out for a wet walk.  Several huge off-leash areas were perfect for him to socialize.  We made veggie rice bowls in the instapot.  Heavy rains beginning in the evening and continuing through the night so happy to be cozy and warm.

Stayed here the last two nights, waiting out some wind and taking care of some business. Now, heading south today to try and escape some of the massive cold front dropping through the nation. Karen read this morning of a massive snow storm that is to hit LOW today. Glad we aren't there.

Dumped and added some fresh h20 this morning. Slight dusting of snow on ground. Got down to 27. Heated rig on "free" electricity , using "fireplace", and small electric heater in garage. Had to turn it down during the night! 

Yesterday, walking through the complex, I was stopped by a truck with 3 guys in it asking what my "business" was in the place? Said it was private property. Won't bore with the details, but turned out he was the owner of the place and there had been complaints that someone was walking around taking pictures of peoples places.

Three nights here. Full hookups. The park owns hundreds of acres of land that they've turned into wonderful mountain bike single track trails. The park restricts trail use to only hikers and mountain bikes. There is also access to blm land for atv use. There are a lot of "toy haulers" here for that reason. 

Park had pickle ball courts, swimming pool, hot tub, laundry. We used the hot tub and pool one night.

park is quiet. Seems everyone keeps to themselves. First 2 days we had a neighbor, Gord, from Canada, whom was personable and friendly. Chatted with Robin and ? when we were in the hot tub. Everyone seems friendly.

We ran into big trouble. Ran the fridge on electricity because of low propane, even though we were low on battery... ~42%. Woke up mid night to beeping sounds, should have run the gen even though "quiet hours". Woke up to worst fear.. batteries dead! Can't start gennie. Went for long walk hoping some cresting sun would charge batteries enough to start generator. Three hours later... success! Whew. Would camp here again.

Gas stop, Blue Beacon stop, late start leaving due to low batteries, threw us into a nightmare scene of driving nearly 80 miles on tight two lane highway with no shoulder and full oncoming traffic with bright lights making night drive extremely difficult. Never again! Glad we made it here safely. Assigned camp site was impossible to turn into due to construction. Finally got assigned another site. None of the available sites were level as per reviews. After leveling in the dark, discovered both tires are off the ground.

Bergen and Wilder came with us to our site after we met them and Ryan at Wilder's pumpkin pie social at her school. We checked out some of the kid activies and had nice meal with them, then bed. Great night. Today they are all ours with one more night together before we move rig to Sonoma campground.

Left Santa Rosa on the 6th for Santa Nella rv park. Stayed there 3 nights. Third night necessitated when discovering broken leaf spring as we were leaving for Lake Buena Vista Campground in Bakersfield. 

CoachNet couldn't get anyone out until next morning. Dave came from San Juan Batista (one hour away) , to replace leaf spring. Charged $300.00 cash!

At Santa Rosa, we cooked a neutral Ac 1 out on Multiplus, while hooked up to 30 --> 50 --> EMS --> 30 cord --> power in.

Bought new Multiplus II from Continous Resources and had it shipped to Lake Buena Vista.

Boosters and flu shots @ Costco on the 12th.

Karen reacted strongly on Tuesday and was over it after sweaty night. I didn't react until Wednesday and am still punky today?!

Two hikes to Wind Wolves Reserve which were fantastic. Bike ride into Bakersfield.

Received Multiplus on Wednesday, installed on Thursday. Still getting low battery warnings!?

Arizona Oasis Rv Resort was so so. We were parked in a pull through next to a couple long term shitty campers. There were plenty of large up scale rigs there. Nice facilities. Swimming pool and hot tub that we didn't use. Karen did laundry in a nice facility.

Arrived yesterday at Quartzsite Dome Rock campsite, 33°38'34.3"N 114°18'33.3"W. Now we are "boondocking" for first time this trip. Got multiplus hooked up and settings from Battleborn, and switched off ups on multiplus to finally get generator operating correctly again. Hopefully we've finally got it all running correctly.

We left Dome Rock @ Quartzsite yesterday the 2nd and drove 3.5 hours nw to Dead Horse Ranch State Park in Az. Upper campground sit 104. 50A with water, no sewer. Lows around 32 every night with highs only getting into the 50's for the next week.

Left our little campsite in Quartzsite with good feelings. Great area for biking.. trails went forever! Most people kept to themselves. We were lucky that we had 2 newer class A's park in our proximity. There were questionable campers/rigs out there when we tooled around. Saw 4 abandoned, ransacked rigs. A newer neighbor took it upon him/herself to dj some reggae full blast during our packout day.

Mostly stayed @ camsite while we were there. Went into Quartsite one day, walked around some venders, grocery shopped, and had a 20" pizza, which was very good.

DHSP looks nice. Not very busy up here. Overlooks Cottonwood. Hoping for some nicer weather!

Yesterday biked for hours on the trails around here scouting for ones we could take together. Although these trails are classified as moderate in difficulty, there are some very challenging parts on all of the trails I rode yesterday.

Karen and Taz walked nearly 4 hours over 8 miles. We had dropped pins and I met up with her once. I rode some of the way towards Sedona checking out a 4x4 road we might take.

Then, riding back around to meet up with Karen, I did a slow motion fall up a steep incline after mis steering into a rock, falling backwards and injuring my left shoulder. Hoping to hell I didn't tear my Rotator Cuff!

"We're doing it" I guess. Time flying by.

Dead Horse State Park was a win. Really liked it. Great unlimited hiking, mtb biking trails. Supposedly "moderate" difficulty mountain bike wise. Actually proved to be above my ability. After biking hours on great single track trails (difficult), I stalled out going up and slow mo tipped over injuring my left shoulder. Never to ride on the trails again. We had some great hikes though.

Drove up to Flagstaff twice to pic up some packages we had sent to Heidi. We took them out to eat first time up there to a Mexican place. Second time drove up to pick up some hydration backpacks that were shipped there and did a quic turnaround back to DHSP. Talked with Jim for a few minutes.. heidi was at work. Then they got pounded with snow. We never got togeter to do the clear creek plunge that Heidi and Jim talked about.

On the 16th, we moved to Distant Drums resort for 2 nights. We had made it on 14 days with our tanks (dumped when we left at DHSP), though we were "burping"(full). Now we know. Found some hiking up a wash across the road. We used the hot tub one night and chatted with one guy (sedona realstate tycoon), and a covid denying couple who were ok. Met Luigi, one of the camp hosts who had a Vizsla. Everyone there said come back!

Left for Salome KOA on the 18th. Were going to stay there for a week and drive to Quartzsite Rv show from there. Mostly a bunch of 4-wheel enthusiasts camping there. Friendly. Trails were all flat. Bordering some dive trailer homes. Lots of glass on trail I "watered" Taz on in the morning. Karen ran there and had better feel about the place than I . Nice folks though. Met Mark and Kathy who left early for Quartzsite to meet friends, when we got back from checking out Quartzsite Long term camping areas ourselves. We decided to cut it short at KOA and commit to Quartzsite for the show. KOA gave Karen full refund, no hassle.

Moved to Quartzite [link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uUf5Aqp9sXCPe3as7) on the 20th. Left early, coffee in the truck, and found a site. So far we're liking the space. Ran gen for hour this am. Batteries were down to 58%. I rode my bike for first time since the fall. Felt good. Should will be ok with normal riding. Will check out show today.

It is warmer were we are now and we moved just in time. Temps were in the 17's north of us

The show was the show, just what you'd expect. Had some good conversations with a couple of venders. Bought: "wash and wax pole and pads", garlic graeter plates (some for gifts), and ice cream (two times). We went to listen to Continuous Resources presentation, who had just replaced our Victron Multiplus II !!. Went on nice mtx bike ride to foothills in our North Laposa campground.. quite a nice long ride with possibilities in the foothills. Less and less campers as we went.

Moved to Leaf Verde Rv park on the 25th. Time for shopping, laundry,and getting some mail/merch sent to us. I upgraded the size of ground cables on our system. Very crowded park. Met some Minnesotans. Randy Knudson and wife Barb right next to us with their cute dog Oscar. Karen had commented that for once there were no political flags flying in the park. Some parks restrict that. Last day their Randy asked for some help installing his flagpole on his ladder. Then he put up the American flag and his trump (small t) flag below it. We were glad to leave the next morning.

But we couldn't believe how happy we were going to be!

Feb 1 we pulled into Lost Dutchman State Park. Site 122 in the Rustic Loop. Liked the site, right up against Superstition mountain. Absolutely stunning. We did two great hikes, lots of climbing, beautiful trails and views. One trail for mtb biking.. ~ 4 miles and went around the campsites. Not great for mountain biking.

Met Paul and Roberta on Wednesday at Red White and Brew for a few and dinner. Thursday we met to visit the tourist trap "Ghost town" nearby. Then decided to leave and visit Tortilla flats (sp?).. small town nestled in valley by a reservoir. A couple beers, chips and salsa, and nice talks. Drove back and were going to meet at our site for dinner/fire. No space for them to park and they decided to just go home.

Next day be begged out of Friday evening dinner and went on beautiful long hike and prepped for leaving next morning.

Feb 4 Picacho Peak State Park. Site C24. Good site. Near Overflow camping sites (6), which look nice. No power and says "No Generators" Would work for us. No mtb trails! But found access to rough 4x trail that circles Picacho. Karen and I rode it for a few miles. Yesterday we did the Sunset Vista trail to the peak. Karen graciously stayed behind with Taz and let me summit. We had some fun talks with folks on the trail. Liking the State Park type of campers.

 Arrived W Justin's Diamond J RV Park on the 10th. We were to boondock for 3 days before site A5 opened up for us today. Christine (Vietnamese) is now charging us $16/night to continue boondocking where we are, and $20 to dump and fill with water at an opening site B29 on Saturday the 18th. We were going to be paying 42/night.

 Nothing special about this park, it is in a little dis-repair, supposedly up for sale. Lots of nice rigs here doing the winter thing.

 Only asset for us is the direct access to great easy mtb bike trails which run into Saguaro National Park (East). We rode yesterday and it was great. Looking forward to a few more rides and hikes.

 New cables arrived here the other day, will install soon while here. Was able to tighten failing gutter/awning along roof that was pulling apart. Drilled and installed some new screws and tightened the rest, and caulked roof/gutter junction again where it had pulled apart. Hope it holds up. Some rain today and colder. High in the 50's today.

Loved the trails behind Justin's! Rode up to Gilberts State campground, which Karen had wanted to get into and rode through the park. Waiting list to get into. Might reserve for next year. Trails!

Was installing new cables for mppt and saw a new camper comming in. Wondering if they were coming in right next to us.. peeked out of the front bay I was working in, and thought I saw someone familiar as this gal was backing up, looking out her window into her side mirror.

It was Cris from [Irene Iron Travels](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSh2BRhXXMveamBDeOhubfQ). Got to meet her, Aaron and Louie. Talked with them twice. The kept very low profile while we were there. Nice people.

Left Justin's Diamond on the 18th and moved to SKP Saguaro Coop, Bensen, Az.

Large coop owned by Escapees. We are "boondocking" on large asphalt island between other leased rv sites for $6/day. Supposedly "have" to move once a site with provisions open up. Think would rather stay put.

Rode up by the water tower yesterday and then up a hiking path that would around on a narrow ridge. Was spooky and fun. Lots of weird eroded ridges/hills/ and washes in this area. We'll be hiking up some today. Weather changed from sunny yesterday to cloudy and colder next few days!.

We left Saquaro for Leasburg Dam State Park on the 25th.

I did ride the Water Tower trail a few times and finally did a long loop. 
Karen checked in to getting on the waiting list $500.

Rhonda and (Chuck?) from Minnesota welcomed us, both worked there. The overall message was "volunteer" if you were lucky enough to get in. Had a great "french toast" breakfast for $10/per made by 5th grade teacher Darcy. She was wonderful.

Leasburge Dam State Park.

We were here for 12 days. Hooked up to 50A electric. Filled up with water once. Dumped when we left.

Found great mtb trails out in the desert. Had to ride ~ mile over interstate overpass to get to trail head.

Met Pete and Dianne from Illinois. They were half timing in a super small trailer (6'x8'), that one couldn't even stand up in. Met them for dinner @BlueMoon one night, bike rode (flats) once, and went into Las Cruses' Farmers Market on a Saturday with them. 

Did a beautiful hikes in Organ Mountains, and Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, and went into Hatch to buy some chilies.

Arrived at Elephant Butte State Park on the 9th of March. Hooked up to 30A service, and has water hookup.

Walked down to lake. Rode West Lakeshore trail yesterday with Taz and trailer. Washouts are tough, trailer low clearance. Good ride and workout. Windy yesterday, Windier today. Montana trailers next to us are from Texas. They partied late into the night last night and are back into it now, right outside our door. Made contact with them with a bad "do you have a license?" "To have such a good time?" They invited us over. I said thanks, maybe later. The guy offering some Jack said "better hurry cuz later we might be abbreviated". We'll see.

Been @ Elephant Butte State Park, Lions Beach, C, #84, for 5 days. We are on the end of a circle loop w/ 2 inner roads. Ours is pointing North and only desert and the lake between us and our nose. Nice hike down to the beach with Taz in the morning for duties. Beach is ~ .5 mile downhill.

So far, biked the West Lakeside trail a few times, biked to the dam, biked through Elephant's Bute (town).

Did "Healing Waters walk in Truth or Consequences" and went the namesakes brewing company after for a nice sit outside for a couple.

Camp host when we got here was young couple in a Skoolie. She was the person at the park entrance that processed our entry. They kept to themselves, only acknowledging me/us, when I said hi, when we almost had eye contact. 

Next host's name is Patricia. I walked out to talk with her after her being here 2 days with no attempt at eye contact/contact. I had to say "Excuse me Host"! twice to get her to turn towards me. She's nice, from Montanna, ~50some, and by her lonesome. Told her to come to us if anything needed. She was appreciative.

Today, went for first of two visits to RiverBend Hot Springs @ 1:00pm. Very nice, low key, multiple pools right on the Rio Grand. $25/per for public pools. Met two couples in our pool, one staying @ rv park in town, site 130, the other living in 55 plus in Williamsburg. Both couples retired and sold their homes last year.

Another week at Elephant Butte: went to hot springs one more time, I we biked to the dam, many hikes on sand/roads around lake. All in all, good experience. Dumped before we left for -->

03/24 Old 76 Harvest host. This was in the town of Ft. Stockton. Small "beer garden" adjacent to a small, dusty dirt, basic cul de sac, type parking area that accommodated 3 rigs. We were the second to show up around 2:00. Big city park adjacent to the area. Band played that evening (8:00 - 1:00 am). Rick Carr Band. They were amazing. We met: Dan and Jonna from Ohio, Hans and Katrina from Germany. Had a great evening. The third rig that pulled in , right next to the venue was a young couple with 2 young children in a beautiful Class A, pulling a new F150. They didn't make it to the venue and had a terrible night with all of the noise.

03/25-26 Dancing Star Ranchica (Boondockers Welcome). Kathleen and her 6 month old boyfriend, smiley Steve. Nice mowed area that could accommodate numerous rigs. We were the only ones for two nights. She was a creative writing professor at the local community college in Kerrville. She also taught some form of music appreciation and was a giant fan of Bob Dylan. She invited us over for a glass of wine at 8:00pm with her friend Steve. Had a nice hour and a half chatting while Taz finally settled down on his pad after socializing with Sasha and Steve's dog.

03/27 Made it to Austin and Mckinney Falls State Park!
Arrived ~ 1:50 to the greeter at the park entrance after waiting in line for 15. Busy! She informed us that there would be no early check-ins (2:00), and that we would have to come back. But, said it would be alright to use the dump station we inquired about, which worked out great for us. Then, back in line to wait another 20 minutes, then pull over and park so that Karen could go in and give truck and rig license plate info that their reservation system wouldn't take. Finally on to our campsite. Person in office instructed Karen to enter from the wrong direction. I had viewed the site on satellite view previously so knew it was wrong. Got to the site carefully tried to navigate in. Knock on the window, camp host next door, informed us that we wouldn't be able to pull in to the "pull through" site.. that we would have to back in. After numerous carefull tries, it was determined the site wasn't going to work. Any fur in the near vicinity was flying. Taz was smartly laying low as pirate dialog sound waves were compressing the air. Todd, the camp host, spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to get office to ok spillover site that would work for our "40 foot rig and giant truck". Finally, we were moved to site 15 and couldn't have been happier except for the giant scratches on the front and all the down the curb side of our rig, and holes torn in the roof. I immediately climbed up on the roof and applied eterna tape to the damaged roof!!!! 

3/28 Karen appointment at West Lake Dermatology clinic 9:40am. They took punch biopsy. Goes back Tuesday for results.
Went to Aaron and Tay's home. Had wonderful Salmon dinner. Wes has been struggling with ear infection. We piled into A&T's 3 row Kia to go pick up Runa from school! :-) We will be going back and forth from their house to trailer in the next few weeks, trying to figure out a rhythm/schedule.

Yesterday morning got up early to meed Chris and Chris, Aaron's mtb riding friends, for an early morning, headlighted bike ride. Whew! Glad I made it back in one piece! They were excellent riders and my skillset was severely challenged!

Last night Aaron and Taylor invited Peter, Alana, Theo, and Casper for dinner. Was a great evening with them. We came back to the trailer after spending the weekend sleeping over at their house.

Temps to be in the 90's for the next two days. Tomorrow A&T are driving their camper here and staying in site 10, right across from us for a night. Cooler weather for a few days after.. with rain.
