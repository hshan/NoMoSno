Ashland RV Campground

Very new well maintained park with level concrete pad sites, very spacious. So new it didn't show up on Google maps satellite view yet. Very easy online check in at the park. Lots of open sites when we arrived on a Thursday evening. Quiet, in town but at the edge. We camped at Ashland RV Campground in a Fifth Wheel.

North Sterling State Park

Very rustic gravel sites that were basically just a turnout of the campground loop. They had nice wind protection shells over the picnic tables. Wide open, scenic views of the reservoir, but the water was really low this time of year. Saw pelicans, deer, and heard coyotes howling at night. Quiet friendly neighbors, many come up from the nearby town of Sterling. The dump station was great, large, easy to access, clean and uncrowded. We camped at North Sterling State Park in a Fifth Wheel

Saddleback RV Park at Battlement Mesa

This is a large RV park with many long term sites as well as mobile homes. We arrived early evening after being unable to find a site anywhere along our route in Colorado. The office was closed but we talked to a couple that told us to find an open site and then pay by check at the office drop box. The sites were a little hard to figure out, each site was Y shaped with A and B designations. Some of the campers there were clearly taking up both sites. We found a paved site with 50 amp power at the edge of the park that seemed to be in the long term rental section but had absolutely gorgeous vistas of the mountains and Colorado River which was great. Very quiet, nice neighbors. Woke to elk bugles in the river valley below-breathtaking. The park is not well maintained but for the price it was worth it and we were very happy with our stay.
Arrive before 6 PM if you want to check in at the office or need to use laundry facilities. They offer 10% discount for Good Sam and 50% for Passport America. We camped at Saddleback RV Park at Battlement Mesa in a Fifth Wheel.

Green River KOA

Stayed here to access Moab, good location at the edge of town. They were booked up for 3 weeks but we were lucky to reserve a site due to a last minute cancellation. All the amenities of a KOA, sites were spacious and level. They had a shared patio area between sites that would be great if you were camping with famiy/friends but was a little awkward if no desire to share your patio with your neighbor. We were there on a Sunday evening and there was very loud grinding/sawing metal building construction activity all afternoon into the evening. Finally at 7:30 PM after dusk, some of the campers went over to ask them to stop and they did (though came back at 7 AM the next morning for an hour to finish). We camped at Green River KOA in a Fifth Wheel.

Cave Lake State Park (Elk Flat Campground)

Arrive early, first come first serve. We arrived around 5 PM and were able to get into the last site in Elk Flats which is the first campground in the park. The road off of hwy 50 is paved except for maybe a half mile of gravel into the park which wasn't too bad. Well maintained gravel, not too rutted. The campground was gorgeous, wooded with beautiful vistas of the mountains, exceptionally clean sites. Very quiet. No electric, water spigots available at various locations. There is a group site available by reservation, and an ADA site that is paved. Each site had a nice cast iron covered fire grill and pit. Our site was pretty tight for a 36 ft fifth wheel but we made it work. We camped at Cave Lake State Park (Elk Flat Campground) in a Fifth Wheel.

 Harvest Hosts .. Lattin Farms Fallon, NV.

 Got our pic of site being first there.. Large dirt parking lot. Really dry and dusty. Karen bought some produce from the store. Steve talked with Farm manager next morning for about an hour. Nice people. Quiet place. Good experience. The town is an oasis in the middle of desert. Topgun movie shot there. Big airforce presence in area though, we weren't bothered ..not much flying when we were visiting.

Arrived at Sir and Ryan's house around 5:30.. just in time for people heading home. Siri directed traffic and after a dozen false starts (due to traffic), finally committed and got the rig in. Ryan held the wires up to clear top of rig. Siri and Ryan had spent some time trying to clear branches and limbs that might rip roof. Took it slow and made it in with no permanent damage. Some awning covers were jerked off.

We are here at Petaluma, already going on the third day! Today Siri went into her shop to work after noon. Wilder and Bergen went to their community family's home until 5:00pm. Karen and Siri went for a run. I cleared out the garage and rode bike on cyclops for first time. Ryan is cooking dinner tonight. Pad thai I think. Karen just left to pick up Siri and the kids. Ryan and Siri bought a play castle, used for $400.00 that we have to try and pick up sometime and assemble.

Day five with the Fritches. This was yesterday (forgot to write). Slowly getting rig things in order. Bought new 120v --> 30amp connector after one yesterday nearly melted?! Able to drain gray water through hose now that amazon delivered hose connection yesterday.

Siri said she is feeling very strange today.. not as much sickness but more beside herself, maybe depleted. She went to work today @ 10:00 . Sale going on. Meeting individuals on a schedule.. one to one.

No daycare tomorrow or the rest of the week Siri told me on phone.

Ryan baked awesome pizza on his pizza oven last night! So good!

Karen ran on roads today with Taz. I lifted weights. Ryan watered plants and out in studio mostly. His "Hackintosh"'s bluetooth doesn't work.

We tried to go to Dillon Beach yesterday, but it was full. So, we went bach through Tomale and down to Key Creek Fishing Accesss. Crossed the river and the kids swam and played for hours. All of them.

Day six. Much better air today. Temps cool. Siri home today. Karen and I went to Costco for first time since getting here. James and Ryan picked up the swingset/playhouse. Much smaller then I thought. Will probably be a project next day or two. Wilder watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Very shaky internet connections here. So frustrating. Had fun night with kids. Wilder cuddling, Bergen and Wilder teasing me .. taking away my hat. First Presidential debate was tonight. Not presidential.

I missed a few days. Three days ago Ry cooked Thai with nan. Two days ago was our day, but Ry couldn't resist :-)  .. "helped with" Huevos, I did the turkey "sausage" and tortillas. 

Yesterday, Aaron, Taylor, and Runa made it here around 5:00pm! Parked and situated right next to each other.

Wonderful meal Ryan cooked mostly. Steak and cod burritos. I did the tortillas and Mahi Mahi.

Yesterday Ryan and I got the swingset all put together after a few trips to landscpaper for ground prep. Kids loved it!

Smoke was good yesterday! This am woke to fog and little smoke! Looking to be wonderful day! 

Siri and Ryan's 6th wedding anniversary today. They plan to go out alone for an evening meal!

We stayed in Schuyler (skyler) Nebraska , at a cute little campground that was supposed to be closed Nov 1. North lake county park near Columbus Nebraska closed Nov 1st. Luckily Karen called while on the road and we were able to find this place.

Karen ran last night on the paved path around the little pond. I dumped water again and re-filled to rid of chlorine hopefully. Full 50A hookup which we didn't need (sewer) for $15. Only one other 5th wheel here. Quite a bit of local dog walkers use the trail.

Met a local named Gene, an older gentleman that stopped to offer advise when we were backing in. Good natured truck driver with endless stories which were enjoyable. He wouild even listen to a couple of mine. :)

 Pals Brewing Harvist Host, North Platte, Nebraska
 41.092827178143345, -100.79296053746715

 Stayed at Pals Brewing Co. tonight. Nice large area reserved for rv's. We were the only one staying here. Windy and 60some degrees when we got here. Had chips/salsa, large vege pizza, a couple ipa's and ciders. All good. 

 Taz is frustrated. He didn't take over two steps out of the truck to realize we were in goathead territory. Poor guy. Lots of limping and help removing them from his feet.

 Was a comedian playing @ 8:00 tonight. We opted for our trailer. Possible last game of World Series playing on our tv right now.

Vedauwoo Campground, southeast of Laramie, Wy.
41.15604423791822, -105.37733413176802

Pulled in here yesterday afternoon after missing snow the day before. Snow on the ground. Temp in the 30's. Low last night was 24. 8300' elevation. No verizon service. Setup Starlink for first time outside rig. Found a way to route cable through back ramp. Had turned on "roam" on my residential account. Dishy came out of "stow" mode and located satellites. Worked perfectly. Throttled because on roam. 23 down 6 up. Workable.

After setup, hiked 3 mile loop through beautiful rock formations, aspens, and conifers. Probably walked more than 3 because we turned back not knowing what was in front of us, with limited daylight.

Turkey goulash in instant pot for dinner, watched some tv.

Trying to run genny to charge batteries after 2 days of no sun. Genny quit. Couldn't manually start. Furnace and fridge running on propane. Fridge died at night "NO FL" (no flame) error. Batteries dropped to 34% over night.

Learned that there is a high altitude adjustment on the Onana 5500. Got up this am and made adjustment and she fired right up. Remembered a "magnet" reset on the Norcold refrig that I had found on internet one other time we had that trouble at hight altitude. Not sure about the "fix". But working now.

One more walk before we head to Sweetwater :-)

Rock Spring, Wyoming, got in to Sweetwater Event Center late afternoon.  Expansive fairgrounds with over 1200 RV sites with FHUs @ $30/night, can boondock for $10/night.  Easy access from I-80, entered through the "lifestock" entrance and checked in with Kay, one of the caretakers that live on the property.  She charged us $20 for electric hook up only per our request.  Only about 100 sites to choose from that were winterized.  Sites were basically a U-shaped fence on gravel, no rules for how we parked. Free restroom/showers-bldg with individual units consisting of sink, toilet and shower.  Heated and clean. Nice fenced in dog park.  We made broccoli cheese soup in the instapot and Steve grilled deli turkey sandwiches on Gary.  High winds (altitude 6300).

Salt Lake City, Utah:  KOA campground on North Temple right in near downtown (1.3 miles).  No issues traveling here except for intermittent light rains, though there were winter storm warnings in mountainous areas west of SLC.  The KOA campground is massive, with many permanent sites.  Well laid out and nice paved sites although ours was a little uneven. Pool closed but outdoor hot tub open year round (I quickly lost interest due to the pelting rain).  KOA is adjacent to the Jordan River that runs through SLC with a 50 mile long paved trail in the riverside green space, so took Taz out for a wet walk.  Several huge off-leash areas were perfect for him to socialize.  We made veggie rice bowls in the instapot.  Heavy rains beginning in the evening and continuing through the night so happy to be cozy and warm.
